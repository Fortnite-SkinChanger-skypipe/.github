## 🎮 What is a Fortnite SkinChanger?

The Fortnite SkinChanger is a cosmetic-based mod tool that injects cosmetic IDs into your game client. It lets you swap your current outfit for ANY existing skin or item without owning it officially. You’re basically hacking your locker 🛠️🧥

Perfect for:

* Rocking **OG skins** you missed
* Flexing **exclusive collab outfits**
* Using **Mythic rarity** or unreleased stuff
* Creating **custom combos** never seen before

This isn’t some broken glitch. This is **next-level flex mode** 💅.
